A simple statistical NLP application for my human language learning. 
This program currently uses only standard (built-in) python libraries.
Currently used corpus data:
+ Modified Google corpus at http://norvig.com/ngrams/
+ Part of speech word lists at http://www.ashley-bovan.co.uk/words/partsofspeech.html
